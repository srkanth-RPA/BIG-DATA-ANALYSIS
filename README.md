##DESCRIPTION: **Analysis of Large Datasets Using PySpark **
PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, a powerful open-source distributed computing system designed for big data processing. It allows you to process and analyze very large datasets that may not fit into a single machine's memory. PySpark is commonly used in data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning workflows for scalable and efficient computation.
✅ Key Steps Involved in the Analysis
1.Environment Setup:
-Create a SparkSession which acts as the entry point for using Spark functionality.
-Configure Spark to use local resources or connect to a cluster.

2.Data Loading:
-Load data from large files (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) or databases.
-Automatically infer schema or manually define it for performance.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-View schema and sample rows.
-Compute statistics such as mean, min, max, standard deviation.
-Detect and handle missing or null values.

4.Data Cleaning and Transformation:
-Remove or impute missing values.
-Cast columns to appropriate data types.
-Create new columns using built-in Spark functions.
-Join, filter, and group data as needed.

5.Aggregation and Computation:
-Perform distributed aggregations using groupBy, agg, and window functions.
-Efficiently process millions or billions of rows using Spark’s in-memory computation.
